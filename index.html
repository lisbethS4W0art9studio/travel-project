        <h2>Why Belfast?</h2>
        <h3>Belfast, the city of CS Lewis and natural beauty</h3>
        <p>Can't mention Belfast without mentioning the ocean liner Titanic, once famous for being the largest
          ocean liner in the world, thus sinking in 1912. Opening in 2012, one hundred years after the sinking,
          Titanic Belfast, an open interactive museum opened.
        </p>
        <p>Belfast Murals are a lasting legacy and are dotted throughout the city, telling
          the stories of Belfast and can be enjoyed as a tour group or alone. Belfast is steeped in musical history
          and heritage. You can walk through certain parts of the city on any night of the year, thus guaranteed to
          stumble into a pub or club with live music. The incredible exports of music include the likes of
          Van Morrison, Snow Patrol, The Divine Comedy and Ash.
